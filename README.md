# bankruptcy-prediction
-Using the Polish companies dataset from UCI repository to predict bankrupt vs non-bankrupt

-There has been a lot of research over this classification problem using different machine learning and deep learning text classification algorithms. 

-This is a team project. We implemented Bagging, boosting classifiers, and multilayer perceptron algorithm with backpropogation.

-From the results we achieved, we conclude that bagging classifier outperformed the other classification models. 

-More tweaks coming up soon regarding feature selection for bagging classifier.
